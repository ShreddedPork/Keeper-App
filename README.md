# Keeper-App
- Scope of this app was to be more familiar with how to use MERN stack as a full stack web application and how to use CRUD.

## What I Have Used
- For the backend server environment, I used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) framework to design application layer.
- For the persistence of data, I used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) as my database to store user's notes.
  - A note schema will hold title and content.
- For the frontend i used [React.js](https://en.reactjs.org) library to design the client side of the application.
